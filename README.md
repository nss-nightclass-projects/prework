# Welcome to Nashville Software School!

Thank you for choosing us to guide you through your journey to become a software developer!

We want to ensure that you are as prepared as possible for the technologies and concepts that your instruction staff will be coaching you through in the first few weeks, so we have prepared a pre-work program. These resources will provide you with the basic skills, terminology, and context for what it will be like at Nashville Software School.

> The pre-work is mandatory - not optional.

But, and this is VERY IMPORTANT, you have two options for completing the pre-work. Please choose one of the following options:

## OPTION ONE:
When most (if not all of you) interviewed you were sent a link to our pre-work and we suggested that you start working on it at your own pace. We know that some of you have done so because you've sent us the URL for your profile page on TeamTreehouse.com. 

If you have already started the pre-work program that we originally sent you, and esp. if you have already subscribed to TeamTreehouse, you should continue to complete the pre-work assignments as sent. Those will prepare you well to hit the ground running the first day of class. BUT - if you have not really started the originally sent pre-work yet, or if you are paying month to month for TeamTreehouse.com and have only done the Digital Literacy material, then you should shift to pre-work option two.

## OPTION TWO:
We have just finished a redesign of our pre-work with the goal to use only free resources wherever possible. That means that a subscription site like TeamTreehouse.com is no longer part of the pre-work (nothing wrong with TeamTreehouse - it has served NSS students well for many years now, but it does cost money). Also, there are many outstanding learning resources available today that were not available when we last redefined our pre-work and we wanted to work some of them into the program. 

To start on our new pre-work program, you can find the link to the first page of the instructions here: https://nashville-software-school.github.io/prework/

The new pre-work is what I would call a beta version, so we will be looking for feedback from all of you taking this path on how we can improve our instructions/content.
